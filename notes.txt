>> ASYNC CODE
- Necer run any fetch request of asynchronous code in our reducers.

- There are 2 main options to run async code
1. Inside the components
2. Inside the action creators.

>> BACKEND VS FRONTEND
- When we have a backend API of our choice, we just have to send the data where it will be transformed in desired format.
- But in our case, we have a dummy backend which doesn't have much logic, it just stores data, so we have to transform data in the frontend first and then dispatch the data

>> WHERE TO PUT OUR CODE
- There are three options.
1. Fat Reducers.
2. Fat Components.
3. Fat Actions

- First differenciate between sunchronous and side-effect free code (i.e data transformations) and Async code or code with side effects.

- PREFER reducers and AVOID Action Creators or Components in case of synchronous side effect free code.

- PREFER Action Creators and Components and AVOID reducers in case of asynchronous code and code with side effects.
